    <h2>
        My name is Jonah Layton, and I am studying Information Technology. I'm in my 5th semester of school 
        this year and plan to graduate in Fall 2025. I am from Denver, Colorado. In my free time I enjoy hiking 
        and traveling. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Other times I play video games and hang out with friends. Some games that I enjoy playing 
        are Rocket League and Call of Duty. Some story games can be fun as well. I have lived in Colorado my 
        whole life but left for school to meet new people and make new friends. I enjoy watching the Broncos, 
        the Nuggets, and college basketball. I am in the Sigma Phi Delta fraternity, and I have made some great 
        friends. After I graduate college, I want to join the FBI or the Navy
